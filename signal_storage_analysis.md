# Signal Storage Analysis Update

## ‚úÖ **SIGNALS ARE ALREADY LIMITED**

### **Good News: Signal Storage is Already Managed**
```typescript
setSignals(prev => [...prev.slice(-9), signal]);
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Signals are limited to last 10 (slice(-9) + new signal)

## üîç **REMAINING MEMORY LEAK INVESTIGATION**

Since both technical analysis AND signals are already managed, the memory leak must be elsewhere:

### **Potential Sources Still to Check**

#### **1. Position Storage**
- **Location**: Portfolio state
- **Check**: Are closed positions accumulating?

#### **2. AI Model Data**
- **Location**: AIPredictionModel service
- **Check**: Is training data accumulating?

#### **3. WebSocket Message Buffer**
- **Location**: BinanceWebSocketService
- **Check**: Are messages buffering indefinitely?

#### **4. React Component State**
- **Location**: Various components
- **Check**: Are there unmanaged state arrays?

## üéØ **NEXT INVESTIGATION TARGETS**

1. **Portfolio positions** - Check if closed positions are cleaned up
2. **AI model memory** - Check training data accumulation
3. **WebSocket buffers** - Check message buffering
4. **Component state** - Check for other growing arrays

**Status**: Need to dig deeper into other components
