# Trading Bot with Memory Management Framework

## Project Overview
This project is a robust trading bot designed to automate trading activities through a comprehensive memory management and endurance testing framework. It integrates real-time data from Binance.US and employs advanced machine learning models for making trading decisions. The bot is equipped with features for monitoring trades, managing risk, and ensuring system stability during extended operation.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-bot.git
   cd trading-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and fill in your Binance API keys and other necessary configurations.

4. **Start the application:**
   Run the application in development mode.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser to access the trading dashboard. From there, you can connect to the Binance API, view real-time market data, and monitor trades.

## Features
- Real-time trade monitoring and logging.
- Comprehensive memory management framework that prevents memory leaks.
- Advanced trading signals generated using machine learning models.
- Position management including buy/sell actions based on our trading strategy.
- Endurance testing scenarios to validate system stability under various conditions.
- Customizable configuration for trade parameters, including take profit and stop loss.

## Dependencies
This project uses several dependencies as found in `package.json`:
- **React**: Framework for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library.
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-service for data management.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication protocol to interact with the Binance API.
- And other libraries needed for memory management, testing, and data visualization.
