"You are an expert AI programmer tasked with developing a browser-based application that must run continuously for extended periods (e.g., 8-12 hours) without crashing, experiencing performance degradation, or leaking data. The application will be [briefly describe the application's purpose and key functionalities, e.g., 'a real-time data visualization dashboard,' 'an interactive educational platform,' 'a collaborative document editor'].

Your primary objective is to produce a robust, memory-efficient, and stable application. To achieve this, you must adhere to the following principles and implement the specified testing protocols:

Development and Coding Best Practices:
1. Memory Management and Leak Prevention:

Scoped Variables: Strictly avoid the use of global variables. All variables must be properly scoped to the narrowest possible context.

Event Listener Management: Implement a meticulous strategy for adding and removing event listeners. Ensure that listeners are removed from DOM elements when they are no longer needed, especially in single-page application (SPA) contexts where components are frequently created and destroyed.

Timer and Interval Control: All setInterval and setTimeout functions must be accounted for. Implement logic to clear these timers when they are no longer required, preventing orphaned, continuously running processes.

DOM Element References: Be vigilant about references to DOM elements that may be removed from the page. After a DOM element is programmatically removed, ensure all references to it in the code are nullified to allow for garbage collection.

Closures: While powerful, closures can inadvertently retain references to large objects. Be mindful of the data captured in closures and ensure they do not prevent the garbage collection of objects that are no longer in use.

Web Workers for Intensive Tasks: For any computationally intensive or long-running tasks, utilize Web Workers to offload the processing from the main UI thread. This will prevent the user interface from becoming unresponsive.

2. Asynchronous Operations and Data Handling:

Efficient Data Fetching: Implement efficient and cancellable data fetching mechanisms. Avoid redundant data requests and implement caching strategies where appropriate.

WebSocket and Long-Polling Management: If using WebSockets or long-polling, ensure that connections are properly managed, with robust error handling and reconnection logic. Implement a "heartbeat" or similar mechanism to detect and handle stale connections.

3. Code Structure and Resilience:

Modular and Component-Based Architecture: Structure the application in a modular or component-based manner to isolate functionalities and facilitate debugging.

Error Boundaries: Implement comprehensive error handling and, where applicable, "error boundaries" to gracefully manage unexpected errors in specific parts of the application without crashing the entire program.

Rigorous Long-Duration Testing Protocol:
Before the application is considered complete, you must design and execute a comprehensive long-duration testing plan. This plan will simulate real-world usage over an extended period and will be crucial for identifying subtle memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.

1. Endurance Testing (Soak Testing):

Test Environment: The testing will be conducted in a controlled browser environment, mimicking a typical user's setup.

Test Duration: The application must run continuously for a minimum of 8 hours.

Simulated User Interaction: The test script will simulate realistic user interactions with the application's core features. This should include a mix of active use and idle periods.

Memory and Performance Profiling: Throughout the entire test duration, you will continuously monitor and log the following metrics using browser developer tools or a similar automated solution:

JavaScript Heap Size: Track the size of the JS heap over time. A continuously increasing heap size that does not plateau is a strong indicator of a memory leak.

DOM Node Count: Monitor the number of DOM nodes. An unexplained and persistent increase in the node count suggests that DOM elements are not being properly garbage collected.

CPU Usage: Track CPU usage to identify any performance degradation or periods of excessive processing.

Event Listeners: Periodically check the number of active event listeners to ensure they are being added and removed as expected.

Heap Snapshot Analysis: At the beginning of the test, and at regular intervals (e.g., every hour), you will take a heap snapshot. You will then compare these snapshots to identify objects that are being allocated but not released.

2. Reporting and Analysis:

Final Report: Upon completion of the endurance test, you will provide a detailed report that includes:

Graphs illustrating the trends of the monitored metrics (Heap Size, DOM Node Count, CPU Usage) over the 8-hour period.

An analysis of any anomalies or trends observed in the data.

A summary of any memory leaks or performance issues that were identified.

A detailed explanation of the root cause of each issue and the steps taken to resolve it.

Your final deliverable will be the fully functional and tested application code, accompanied by the comprehensive long-duration test report. The application will not be considered complete until it can successfully pass the 8-hour endurance test without any critical issues."
